          <p>La Casa Azul, an electric-blue house in Mexico City's Coyoacan district, is more pilgrimage site than museum. That's because it once was home to Frida Kahlo, the famous artist whose work—and mystique—is known and revered around the world. Now it houses a vast collection of her work and personal effects, and is one of the city's most frequented stops for art-loving tourists. But, to visit the densely packed space, or even the grandiose Palacio de Bellas Artes, is to scratch the surface of this constantly-buzzing city's creative scene.</p>
          <p>New destination-worthy museums open every few years in Mexico's capital: Take 2011's ultra-modern Soumaya, stocked with the personal collection of the multi-billionaire Carlos Slim, and 2013's Museo Jumex, which houses an impressive collection of contemporary art in an imposing, jagged building. And that's not even mentioning the one-room galleries and hole-in-the-wall music venues that pop up seemingly ever week, or the art fairs, like February's Zona Maco, which draws crowds rivaling Art Basel in Miami Beach.</p>

          <p>You'd be forgiven for thinking Kyoto's nickname, the "City of Ten Thousand Shrines," is an exaggeration. But after a walk through its beautifully preserved streets, you'll quickly be correcting your assumption. While it's hard to nail down the exact number of shrines—new ones seemingly pop up overnight—there are at least 1,600 temples within the city limits. There are the world-famous landmarks, of course—think the vermillion gates of Fushimi Inari-taisha and the shimmering Golden Pavilion of Kinkaku-ji. But the truly magical thing about Kyoto is the way you can explore the city, without a guide book or itinerary, and stumble upon Zen gardens, sprawling temple complexes, and immaculately maintained shrines with nary a tourist in site. Its seventeen UNESCO World Heritage sites speak to this ancient capital's cultural significance, but they're really just the beginning when it comes to all the beauty that Kyoto offers.</p>

          <p>At its peak, the Roman Empire extended over nearly two million square miles of land across Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa. Today, that history—and the far-flung influences that made their mark on this ancient capital—are on display everywhere. (Vespas zip by the Roman Forum, which dates back to the seventh century BC, like its no big deal.) The recently restored Colosseum is such a part of the modern city's fabric that after a few days you start taking its grandeur for granted.</p>
          <p>The city's main attractions are famous not because of tourist hype, but because they really are that impressive—the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Capitoline Museums...the list goes on and on. No wonder it's known as the Eternal City: You could spend forever here and find new artistic and cultural treasures every day.</p>

          <p>It's the boundary between two continents; the entry-point into Europe for the Silk Road that extended all the way to the Korean peninsula; a place where you can sip an espresso in a third-wave coffee shop, steps from a Roman aqueduct, while the call to prayer emanates from a mosque that was built in the time of the Ottomans. There are the classics, of course, like the syncretic Hagia Sophia—once a church, then a mosque, and now a museum—and the famous Whirling Dervishes whose entrancing, twirling dance is an act of devotion to their Sufi faith.</p>
          <p>But under all that history and millennia-old tradition is a thriving, and subversive, hip-hop, contemporary art, and film scene, spurred by creators who use their expression as a way to comment on the turbulent times the country currently finds itself in. To find up-and-coming and established creatives alike, start with a Saturday evening in Karaköy, where Istanbul's old-meets-new aesthetic is in full bloom. Or head to the 15th Istanbul Biennale, taking place from September 16 through November 12, where everything from modern dance to street art will be on display</p>

          <p>The bustling city of Rio de Janeiro has been one of Brazil’s most popular and frequented tourist destinations for decades. Its vibrant city centre is bursting with culture and pulsating with a deep sense of history and heritage. Rio, as it is commonly known, is the second largest city in Brazil and the third largest metropolis in the whole of South America.</p>
          <p> It is the most visited city in the Southern Hemisphere, which is no mean feat. This makes for an impressive, memorable attraction for visitors from all over the world.</p>
          <p>Rio de Janeiro is hot for most of the year, and rain is frequent during the period between December and March. The coastal areas are cooler than those situated inland due to the cool breeze blowing off the blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The average annual temperature is between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius. The landscape and vegetation in and around this metropolis are magnificent, providing a visual feast that has inspired authors and screenwriters the world over.</p>
          <p>Because of its many cultural and historical attractions, Rio has implemented fabulous infrastructure to cater to the needs of its visitors. This includes world-class accommodation and plenty of tours. Rio de Janeiro was one of the Host Cities™ for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™, welcoming millions of people as they make their way to this international sporting event. In addition, it did host the 2016 Summer Olympics™, inviting sportsmen and –women, as well as their millions of fans, to focus their attention on this bustling destination. Major efforts have been made to minimise social inequality and modernise the economy of Rio de Janeiro to further improve its global standing. This makes for a very special destination.</p>
